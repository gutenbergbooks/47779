of contributing to the study of the subject, not only mere learning and skill in summing
up and expounding the results of the researches of prior scholars, but also fresh and
illuminative ideas of the editor’s own. It is an edition which reflects every credit upon
its author’s learning and critical acumen, and which cannot but prove heartily welcome
to all classes of Greek scholars.”—<i>Scotsman.</i></span></p>

book is excellently planned and executed. Broken up into short paragraphs, with
headings to arrest the attention, his manual does equal justice to the personal and the
constitutional aspects of the story. Special credit is due to an author who, in the
compilation of an elementary work of this kind, faces the difficulties of his subject with
conscientious skill, neither ignoring them nor eluding them with a loose phrase, but
striving to explain them in the simplest and briefest statements.”&mdash;<i>Journal of Education.</i></span></p>
